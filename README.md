# GundamFVZ

Turn based fighting game in lieu of Pokemon on Gameboy

Federation Vs Zeon

protect the colony from a Zeon invasion, fight against The Red Comet himself, Char Aznable

you are piloting the ever so infamous Gundam RX78, as you see a flash of light, that crimson Zaku II

the RX78 is equipped with a beam rifle (10HP) and a beam saber (5HP)
the Zaku has drum magazine machine gun (10HP) and a heat hawk (5HP)

additionally there is a health regen that can be used twice in the battle that restores hp with math.random() up to 15HP

each player takes turns to fight; starting with player 1 and then the computer attacks back while both choosing which attack to use (each attack does different damage and has an accuracy instance), whomever runs out of HP first, their mobile suit explodes and the last mech standing wins!
